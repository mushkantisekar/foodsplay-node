=========

A simple nodejs app demostrating js as a powerful language for full-stack operation.


### Install
Just clone the repo and run `npm install` and then `node app.js`.
Plus, you need to setup a workable mongodb server or choose to use a mongodb provider 
(e.g. mongohq).
After that, use Google Chrome to open `http://127.0.0.1:3000` and you are ready to try.

### Features

As a demo app, a lot of bugs exist, and you are free to change it at your will.
Some tools I used in the app are:
* express + connect
* great MVVM framework __knockout__
* everyauth
* simple oauth2 server
